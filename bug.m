This bug demonstrates an uncommon issue in Objective-C related to the use of `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` with selectors that take objects as arguments.  If the object passed to `withObject:` is deallocated before the selector is invoked, a crash may occur. This is because the selector will attempt to use a pointer to an already deallocated object.

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
- (void)myMethod:(NSString *)str;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)myMethod:(NSString *)str {
    NSLog(@"My method called with string: %@", str);
}

- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"MyClass deallocated");
}
@end

@interface ViewController : UIViewController
@end

@implementation ViewController
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    NSString *string = [NSString stringWithString:@"Hello"];
    MyClass *myObject = [[MyClass alloc] init];
    myObject.myString = string;
    [self performSelector:@selector(callMethod:) withObject:myObject afterDelay:2.0];
    //myObject is released, causing potential crash after 2.0 seconds
}

- (void)callMethod:(MyClass *)obj {
    [obj myMethod:obj.myString]; //Crash if obj is deallocated
}
@end
```
